Collection of every day I have worked on this project and mainly just a log of me divulging into madness 
## Log #1 

Day: Thursday | Date: 14 October 2021

Reinstalled Node and NPM for the most current versions, installed truffle and Ganache. Following [Dapp University's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY0xL8V6NzzFcwzHCgB8orQ) tutorial series for creating a EC20 blockchain. 

Problems: Not returning correct token supply 
```powershell
 0 passing (262ms)
  1 failing

  1) Contract: Token
       sets the total supply on deploy:

      The total supply is 100000
      + expected - actual

      -0
      +100000
```

was a problem with my truffle config and the solidity version so a set to "^0.8" but still fucked

Troubleshooting <br>ya okay I have no clue what the fuck I am doing <br> ok so [this link](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/simple-erc20-token-example/4403) kinda looks like it makes sense I should probs just go back to following dapp but this shit doesn't work and its 6am so goodbye I am going to mine RavenCoin.

Day: Actually saturday | Date: 16 October 2021

3 hours of sleep and on a webdev meeting but wanted to write down what the french men told me so I don't forget

<br>

Okay it has been a second and I have talked to french men and they have notes: 

- Balanced economy 
  - Dont have everything inflate to an obscene point like WOWC
    - What but how to tho cuz as the price of the coin goes up everything will need to go up as well unless to some type of stable

  - Possibly NFT sharing 
    - Can steal NFT's from people (possibly in a time frame) but the shares dilute over time 

- This [coin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/blockchain-sdk-by-enjin-124133) as the currency possibly so making an erc20 token could be a waste of time
  - need to get an account 

- MMO and preferably a world but I would like to just be able to do a small one first

I HAVE COME UP WITH AN IDEA. Chess but you put up a bet each game into a pool winner takes all. 

  - Made a todo page
  - Look at [crypto.games](https://crypto.games/minesweeper/ethereum) someone could lose a lot of money doing this 
      - dw i only but 0.01 eth in its chill 
      - But that addictive thrill is kinda scary I wonder if this will ever ruin someones life.
